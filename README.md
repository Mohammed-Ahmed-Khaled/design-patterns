# Singleton Database Pattern in Dart

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **Singleton Design Pattern** in Dart by ensuring only one instance of a `Database` class is created.

## Features
- Implements a **private constructor** to restrict instantiation.
- Uses a **static instance** to ensure only one object is created.
- Provides a **factory method** `getInstance()` to return the same instance.
- Demonstrates the singleton pattern by comparing two instances.
