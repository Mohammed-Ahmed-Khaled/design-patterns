# SOLID Payment System in Dart

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **Simple Payment System** in Dart, applying the **SOLID principles** to ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

## Features
- Implements **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** by separating concerns.
- Follows **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** for easy extension with new payment methods.
- Ensures **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** by using a common `Payment` interface.
- Applies **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** by keeping interfaces focused.
- Uses **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** by depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
